# Aphasia

This app's design was mostly inspired from Gary Simon's video (mentioned above), with a random canva template logo sticked to it. Its available for android from either below or from the releases tab. You can also build it yourself, refer to the below section.

### Building it

- Clone this repo and open up a terminal inside the folder.
- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter build apk`
- Done. It should be in build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

[Android](./files/app.apk)
